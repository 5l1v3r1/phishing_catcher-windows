I just edited the modules, for people who have problems with compiling on Windows.
You will need the following python packages installed: certstream, tqdm, pyentrp, termcolor, tld, python_Levenshtein
I am not sure, but i think Levenshtein and certstream must be installed with pip2.7. It cant work with Python3 because of Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler for Python 2.7
